This (FITS) image files are subsets of the occasional engineering data from the readout process of the Basic Angle Monitor (BAM) CCDs acquired through the on-board Service Interface Function (SIF), which allows downlinking information otherwise discarded on-board before transmission. These BAM CCD images provide the most suitable data set, because of two reasons: (1) these are the only CCDs on board Gaia, which are operated in a stare mode with several seconds exposure time in addition to the nominal TDI readout mode, and (2) the particular readout window subsets contain apart from the cosmic rays no other external signal source but a relatively low and constant background that has been removed in a pre-processing step.
