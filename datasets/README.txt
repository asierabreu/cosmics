Proton Stopping Power Public Data Available @ : https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Star/Text/PSTAR.html

The PSTAR program calculates stopping power and range tables for protons in various materials. Select a material and enter the desired energies or use the default energies. Energies are specified in MeV, and must be in the range from 0.001 MeV to 10000 MeV.

Relevant documentation on Stopping Power definition can be found under the docs directory (Radiation Interactions with Matter)
