This subdirectory is a mirror of the spark (and other) scripts used for the first extraction and post-processing.

NOTE: The import statements are all currently written assuming that this folder is ~/spark on the machine it is executed. It needs to be replaced for every __init__.py in "libs" and every spark script in "scripts"
